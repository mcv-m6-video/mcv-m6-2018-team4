# Week 2 - Code Explanation
- **General:**
  - ../dataset.py: class that reads the specific frames of a given dataset.
  - ../evaluation.py: some useful functions for evaluate the resluts.
- **Task 1:** Gaussian distribution
  - gaussian_modelling.py: class that implements the gaussian model background substraction
  - week2.py: Launcher of the task 1.1 (single_execution() function).
  - week2.py: Launcher of the task 1.2-1.3 (f1score_alpha() and precision_recall_curve() functions for evaluation).
- **Task 2:** Adaptive modelling.
  - gaussian_modelling.py: class that implements the gaussian model background substraction (use 'adaptative_ratio' parameter)
  - week2.py: Launcher of the task 2.1 (single_execution() function).
  - week2.py: Launcher of the task 2.2 (grid_search() and precision_recall_curve() functions for evaluation).
- **Task 3:** Compare with state-of-the-art
  - SOTA_backgroundSubstractor.py: Launcher of the task 3 that have the state of the art implementations.
- **Task 4:** Color sequences
  - gaussian_modelling.py: class that implements the gaussian model background substraction (use 'grayscale_modelling=False')
  - week2.py: Launcher of the task 4 (single_execution() function).
